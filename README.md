# MicroCT
Automated analysis of MicroCT Images of Mice with Fibrodysiplasia Ossificans Progressiva. The edge detection protocol uses Canny Edge Detection and Convex Hull. This is compiled over all images to analyze the area and volume of bone to tissue in a mouses hind leg. 

# Before
Researchers would analyze 500 images per scan by hand looking for bone. This would take up to 3 hours and could cost a laboratoryup to 2000 dollars. 

# After
Researchers can export and run this protocol on there scan and have the area and volume of bone and tissue is in just seconds.
